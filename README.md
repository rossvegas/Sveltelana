# Sveltelana

This project is a very small app designed to help secondary and tertiary students get a web project functioning. I noticed when my daughter was creating a couple of pages in CodePen it was difficult to transition to an actual functioning app that has navigation, reactivity and some data retention ability.

I then created this app to show an example with lots of comments allowing students take their ideas an expand them into functioning apps.

I chose svelte because it is relatively easy to spin up and learn, especially for students who may have HTML and CSS already figured out, and would like to take that and add interactive functionality.

it has the following features

- Master pages
- Navigation
- Typescript 
- Data storage
- Event handling
- Functions in svelte
- Functions in objects
- Reactivity

## Getting started

To run this application you will need to install Node.js and restart your computer

https://nodejs.org/

you will then need to download the source from the Green code button above.

after downloading, open in command line and run the following

```bash
npm intall

npm run dev -- --open
```
In the code the most interesting stuff is in the src folder. Outside of that is more framework related concerns.

I recommend VSCode for editing with the 'Svelte for VSCode extension' 
## Developing

You can find resources for svelte and sveltekit 
https://svelte.dev/
https://kit.svelte.dev/

## Make your own app

To make you own app follow the direction on https://kit.svelte.dev/

I chose the following options
- Skeleton Project

- Yes using TypeScript syntax

- Add ESLint for code linting
- Add Prettier for code linting

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
